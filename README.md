# Diabetes-Prediction


Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction System project! ü©∏

### Overview
This project aims to predict diabetes using machine learning techniques. After meticulous data preprocessing and cleaning, I experimented with various algorithms. Among them, the Random Forest Classifier emerged as the most accurate model, providing reliable predictions for diabetes.

### Algorithms Explored

- Logistic Regression
  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
  
- Decision Tree Classifier
  
- **Random Forest Classifier (Selected for Maximum Accuracy)**
  
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
  

### Why Random Forest?

The Random Forest Classifier, with a maximum depth of 3, demonstrated superior accuracy among the explored algorithms. Its ensemble learning approach, coupled with careful parameter tuning, resulted in robust predictions for diabetes.
